# Personal Setup for MacOS
A repository of dotfiles to configure my development environment.

The implementation of these scripts are inspired by [CoreyMSchafer](https://github.com/CoreyMSchafer/dotfiles.git) but tailored to my own needs.

## Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine and navigate to its directory:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/andrematte/macos-personal-setup.git ~/dotfiles
   cd ~/dotfiles
   ``` 
2. Run the main script:
    ```sh
    ./install.sh
    ```
